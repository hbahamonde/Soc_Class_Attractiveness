We could use both the rates data+rating data + voting data here. We could analyse whether the persons reprsenting your own socio-economic class are considered more attractive and we could look whether this brings more votes to these particular candidates ~ that is class-based attractiveness & its consequences to inequality in voting outcomes.  competing hypothesis would suggest the universal Beauty standards and outcomes accordingly. I think we should ISEI-scale to occupation to compare attractiveness raters own versus candidates ISEI.

To be clear: we could forget occupation-congruent appearance in this paper and concentrate purely on attractiveness
